## Child Template Example

This document is designed to be built with the quarto template as an example child. It is implemented modularly to make the format easier to work with. Example R code is provided to test the functionality when adding it into the template document.

Function test:
$$
Z_{a,j} = F_{a,j} + M_{a,j}
$$

Linear model and results for R code test:

```{r mod-res}
#| echo: false

mod1 <- lm(cars$speed ~ cars$dist)
plot(mod1)
```
